# Fuzzy-Lookup-Data-Pipeline
A work project that automates the entire Fuzzy Lookup process. 

The code here is a sample for demonstration to the general public and has been modified accordingly.

The query pulls data directly from the Microsoft SQL Server, preformats it, runs the Fuzzy Lookup matching process, and then saves the output.
